# Classic Snake Game in Java

## Project Overview
This project is a modern implementation of the classic Snake game, developed using Java. It showcases an efficient use of object-oriented programming principles, GUI development skills, and game logic design. The game is built with Java's AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) and Swing libraries, demonstrating proficiency in creating interactive and responsive GUI applications.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Grid Layout**: The game grid is rendered using Java's AWT library, ensuring smooth rendering and movement.
- **Responsive Snake Mechanics**: The snake, implemented as an array of `Tile` objects, responds intuitively to keyboard inputs for a seamless gaming experience.
- **Collision Detection**: Custom logic to detect collisions with the game's boundaries and self, enhancing the gameplay challenge.
- **Scoring System**: A scoring system that tracks the length of the snake, updating in real-time as the snake consumes food.
- **Customizable Game Settings**: Easily adjustable parameters like board size and tile size for varied gameplay experiences.
- **Simple Yet Engaging UI**: A straightforward and visually appealing user interface, leveraging AWT and Swing components.

## Technical Stack
- **Language**: Java
- **Libraries**: AWT for graphics and event handling, Swing for GUI components
- **IDE**: Developed and tested in IntelliJ IDE

## Future Enhancements
- Add difficulty levels (e.g., increasing speed).
- Implement a leaderboard system.
- Introduce power-ups or additional obstacles.
